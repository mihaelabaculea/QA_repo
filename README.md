After completing QA Manual Course I've decided to wrap up the key points and concepts of manual testing and to have it gathered here for an easy access. In the following I am going to compress the information presented in the course, structured according to the most important topics. 

What is QUality Assurance?
It is a set of measures that ensures the required level of quality of the product at every stage of its life cycle.

What is QUality Control?
It is a set of actions performed on the product in the development process with the purpose of obtaining information about its current state, compliance with the requirements, level of quality and readiness for release. 

What is Software Testing?
It is one of the quality control techniques to check whether the actual software product meets all the expected requirements and to ensure that it is defect free.

Benefits of software testing:
1. Cost effective - bugs caught in the earlier stages of testing cost less to fix
2. Security - helps in removing risks and problems earlier
3. Product quality - ensures that quality product is delivered to customers
4. Customer satisfaction

Validation vs. verification
Validation is confirmation that the requirements for the product meet needs of the end user "is this the right specification?".
Verification is confirmation of compliance of the product with the specified requirements "is the system correct to specification?".

Testing principles:
1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing saves time and money
4. Defects cluster together
5. Beware of the pesticide paradox
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-errors is a fallacy

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) defines the full development cycle with tasks related to the planning, creation, testing and deployment of software product.
It has 6 phases:
1. Requirement gathering and analysis - result of the analysis:  Software Requirement Specification -  describes the tasks set for the developers and the ultimate goal of the project from the customerâ€™s point of view
2. Design - defines the hardware and system requirements as well as its overall architecture
3. Implementation or coding
4. Testing - code for the functionality is checked for the compliance with the requirements, involves all types of functional and non-functional testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) is a sequence of specific activities performed during testing process to ensure that software quality objectives are met. It includes both validation and verification
It has 6 phases:
1. Requirement Analysis - test team studies the requirements from a testing point of view to identify testable requirements and the QA team may interact with various stakeholders to understand requirements in detail
2. Test Planning -  a Senior QA manager determines the test plan strategy, efforts, cost estimates, resources, test environment, test limitations and the testing schedule for the project
3. Test case development
4. Test Environment setup - can be done in parallel with the Test Case Development Phase. If the development team provides the environment then test team is required to run smoke test of the environment
5. Test Execution - testing is done based on test plans and test cases
6. Test Cycle closure
