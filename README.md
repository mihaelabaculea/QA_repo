After completing QA Manual Course I've decided to wrap up the key points and concepts of manual testing and to have it gathered here for an easy access. In the following I am going to compress the information presented in the course, structured according to the most important topics. 

What is QUality Assurance?
It is a set of measures that ensures the required level of quality of the product at every stage of its life cycle.

What is QUality Control?
It is a set of actions performed on the product in the development process with the purpose of obtaining information about its current state, compliance with the requirements, level of quality and readiness for release. 

What is Software Testing?
It is one of the quality control techniques to check whether the actual software product meets all the expected requirements and to ensure that it is defect free.

Benefits of software testing:
1. Cost effective - bugs caught in the earlier stages of testing cost less to fix
2. Security - helps in removing risks and problems earlier
3. Product quality - ensures that quality product is delivered to customers
4. Customer satisfaction

Validation vs. verification
Validation is confirmation that the requirements for the product meet needs of the end user "is this the right specification?".
Verification is confirmation of compliance of the product with the specified requirements "is the system correct to specification?".

Testing principles:
1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing saves time and money
4. Defects cluster together
5. Beware of the pesticide paradox
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-errors is a fallacy
